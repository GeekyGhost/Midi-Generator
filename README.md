# Midi-Generator

#Note, Running the included .bat file will create the venv and install the requirements as well as run the main .py script to launch the UI. You just have to cntrl click the link in the cmd window to launch the Gradio UI. Also there's two main scripts and you can use whichever you like, just update the .bat file with the one you want to run. Slightly different UIs and functions. 

This is a work in progress and mainly a test for something else, but working on this helps me with that lol. 

Generating Midi files randomly based on user input. Test UI and functions for a different project.

Make sure you have installed all the required software and packages.
Check that you have an active internet connection, as the script uses the internet to download some dependencies.
